# Employee-Directory-React
This is a React Application to create an Employee Directory. A Simple Functional Pre-Selected List to Better understand React Hooks and States. 

Deployed Heroku Link: https://calm-gorge-66776.herokuapp.com/

Programming Tools => This React Application was built STRICTLY with React Native. Using an npx-create-react command line. The entire front-end is built with React. Using React logic such as Hooks (useState). Combining these with JSX properties within each component. It was a beginning intro to React and to learn more about JSX. Due to this being a strictly FRONT-END React Application, there is no database. The back-end is comprised of a simple server.js with a controller folder to assist with deploying to Heroku and locally.

Description => Built with only React, this application is a model of what a more complex React-built Employee-Directory is capable of doing with React. We can instantly pull names simple through searching for their first few letters of their name. And through this, we can see the efficency of React. It is built with simple HTML and Javascript infused with JSX, so the components are rather simple to follow along to. 

Installation => No Installation is required, simply used the Deployed Heroku Link above.

Future Deployment (Coming Soon) => Future Deployment will happen in future projects as this was a great warm-up project exercise to see the power that React holds. In future projects, utilizing the useState and filtering out searches within the form <tag> will allow us to easily search for names, music, applications, etc. Anything that is being stored within future projects will always be utilizing templates brought from this project.
